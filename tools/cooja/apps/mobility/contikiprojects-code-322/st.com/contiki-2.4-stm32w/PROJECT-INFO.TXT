Contiki version: 2.4
Intended platforms: MB851 and and STM32W108 based board.
Tested platform: MB851
Description:
Port of the contiki operating system to the MB851 board with
STM32W108 microcontroller. It is based on the 2.4 version
with some modifications (essentially to the rimeroute
module); see PROJECT-README.TXT for details. There is also an
uip6_bridge application derived from the sky tool.
The project compiles with the GNU toolchain and also with IAR
(it was tested with IAR Embedded Workbench 5.41 for ARM) and
with IPv6 support, for the moment.
