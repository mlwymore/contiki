*************************** MB851 Demo application ***************************

With this example we show a way that allow you to directly communicate with
the node of the LoWPAN from a PC.
Make sure you have the prerequisites (see PROJECT-README.TXT).

Open contiki-conf.h file in mb851 folder under platform/. You can edit the file to
enable or disable some features or change some parameters. Set
FIXED_NET_ADDRESS to 1 and the prefix of your LoWPAN.The values that are
already present are test addresses and must not be used outside your LAN.

Choose the application you want the nodes to run. Let's choose, for example,
the webserver-ajax application located in the examples folder (you also have to
enable the energy estimation and Rime to test all the features provided with this
app, setting ENERGEST_CONF_ON and WITH_RIME in contiki-conf.h). So, if you
are using Cygwin, type:
	cd contiki-2.4-stm32w/examples/webserver-ajax
	make
Power up the board and, assuming you have your board connected with a USB
cable and the port assigned to your device virtual com is COM4, type in your
command shell:
	make mb851-webserver.flash PORT=COM4
(if you get a message saying "Unable to open port", close all the applications
that use the port).

To build and upload the uip6-bridge application go to tools/stm32w/uip6_bridge,
connect another board to the PC and type:
	make  uip6-bridge-tap.flash PORT=COM5
if, e.g., COM5 is the port assigned to the device.

If you are using a Linux machine build tapslip6 application from tapslip6.c file
located in 'tools' folder ('make tapslip6').
For windows you have to build wpcapslip6 (in tools/stm32w/wpcapslip6 folder).

Open a shell window and type:
	sudo ./tapslip6 -p 2001:db8:bbbb:abcd::/64    
						     (in Linux)
or
	wpcapslip6 -s COM5 -p 2001:db8:bbbb:abcd::/64 <Ethernet card mac address>
						     (in Windows)

if 2001:db8:bbbb:abcd:: is your WPAN subnet prefix (but you don't need to specify
a net address if you use only link-local addresses).
The bridge will answer giving you some informations like MAC address and IPv6
address of the interface.
To simply test reachability of the node, you can do a ping, for example:
	ping6 -c 3 2001:db8:bbbb:abcd:280:e102::6c   (Linux)
or
	ping 2001:db8:bbbb:abcd:280:e102::6c	     (Windows)

To enter the web server page, open the browser and put the address of the
node in the address bar:
	http://[2001:db8:bbbb:abcd:280:e102::6c]
If you have correctly set-up the network you should see a web page! You can
browse to see the estimated cosumption (if you have set ENERGEST_CONF_ON).
You can also put other nodes in the net with the same application and see the
neighbors in the neighbor page  (if you have set WITH_RIME).
