Contiki BBS 2.7.x quick startup guide
=====================================


Preamble:
---------
Contiki BBS is a tiny, little and text based bulletin board system (BBS) for the Commodore 64 homecomputer and a compatible ethernet cartridge (e.g. TFE, RRnet, 64NIC+). It can be accessed through a standard telnet connection and currently provides basic BBS functionality (select from multiple boards, post/read messages, page sysop).

This guide is intended to be used as a quick startup guide. It will cover the compilation and installation of Contiki BBS from source on a Linux system. This guide (c) 2015 by Niels Haedecke. If you just want to run the software without compiling it (e.g. you have downloaded the .d64 disk image), skip to section 10.) of this document.


Prerequisites:
--------------
The following tools are required for a successful compile and installation of Contiki BBS:

* GNU Make

* The cc65 (6502) C compiler

* Git revision control tool

* A second machine (physical or VM) on the same network running a VICE Emulator with ethernet emulation enabled through libnet & libpcap (UNIX/Linux) or WinPCAP (Windows).

NOTE: On Linux you may have to use libnet0-1.0.2a from its original source code archives in order to get ethernet emulation working with VICE, since the libnet packages provided by recent Linux distros (e.g. libnet1) won't work (VICE will not be able to use the 'write_link_layer' function).

Alternatively, a Commodore 64 with a Commodore 1541/1570/1571/1581 disk drive and any compatible ethernet cartridge (e.g. TFE, RRnet, 64NIC+) will work as well. You just have to transfer the D64 image to a 5.25" / 3.5"   disk. Search the web for 'opencbm' for information on how to accomplish this.


How to build Contiki BBS from scratch
------------------------------------
This guide assumes your are using Linux as your development platform. Shell commands needed to be entered will be displayed with the well known UNIX commandline prompt at the beginning. E.g. the following example will show the 'ls' command being issued:

  $ ls


1.) Create a folder where you are going to keep your Contiki and Contiki BBS sources.

  $ mkdir src

2.) Go to your new source folder

  $ cd src

3.) Get sources from Contiki OS git repo:

  $ git clone https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki.git

4.) Get Contiki BBS sources:

  $ git clone https://github.com/lodger-c64/Contiki-BBS.git

5.) Go to the directory containing the Contiki BBS sources

  $ cd contiki-bbs/platform/c64/

6.) Build the binaries

  $ make

7.) Seperately build the Contiki BBS setup program

  $ cl65 -t c64 -o bbs-setup bbs-setup.c bbs-setupfuncs.c bbs-file.c

Voila! You have now built your own Contiki BBS binaries. Now, how do we get these on a D64 disk image?

8.) Still in the source directory, create a D64 disk image (make sure you have set your PATH to point to the c1541 commandline program)

  $ c1541 -format "contikibbs,27" ctkbbs.d64

9.) Write the neccessary files to your new D64 disk image. Depending on what ethernet hardware you are using, you may skip writing *.eth drivers to the image that you don't need in order to save disk space.

  $ c1541 ctkbbs.d64 -write contiki-bbs.c64 contiki-bbs 
  $ c1541 ctkbbs.d64 -write bbs-setup
  $ c1541 ctkbbs.d64 -write cs8900a.eth  
  $ c1541 ctkbbs.d64 -write lan91c96.eth
  $ c1541 ctkbbs.d64 -write w5100.eth
  $ c1541 ctkbbs.d64 -write login.txt
  $ c1541 ctkbbs.d64 -write logout.txt
  $ c1541 ctkbbs.d64 -write menu.txt

Congratulations, you're done! Now you have a working D64 disk image containing Contiki BBS, ready to run in an emulator or to be written back to a real 1541 Disk in order to run it on a real Commodore 64. 

Okay, so this is how to build and prepare Contiki BBS for use on a Commodore 64. Now let's go through the setup process of Contiki BBS itself. So startup your VICE emulator and attach your ctkbbs.d64 disk image to drive 8. You are now at the Commodore 64 BASIC prompt.

10.) Load the Contiki BBS setup program

     LOAD "BBS-SETUP",8,1

11.) Start it ...

     RUN
   

Contiki BBS configuration
------------------------

The main menu will appear
   
     *** Contiki BBS 0.2.7.1 setup ***

     1...BBS base setup
     2...BBS board setup
     3...TCP/IP setup
     4...User editor
     q...Quit


1...BBS base setup

The output below shows an example configuration for the BBS base setup. Feel free to choose your own BBS name, Sysop name and timeout values. If you have more than one disk drive and want to run Contiki BBS off your second drive, you may want to change the default drive number (8) to the drive number of your second disk drive (e.g. 9).  

     * BBS base setup
     
     Enter board drive #: 8
     Enter BBS prompt: BBS>
     Login timeout (seconds): 120
     Session timeout (seconds): 360

Once you have answered the above questions, you will be asked to confirm your input:

     Base data correct (y/n)? 

Enter 'y' if everything is okay or 'n' to re-enter the BBS base configuration values.


2...BBS board setup

Boards are an early predecessor of today's internet forums. It's the place people write their postings. First you will be asked for the total number of boards you want to use. The minimum number of boards is 1. Each board can have a fixed number of messages. If this number is reached, the next posting in the board will start with number 1 again. Below you will see an example output showing the creation of three boards. Please be patient, as the creation of the data files may take some time (especially when you run Contiki BBS on real hardware).

     * BBS board setup

     How many boards? 3
     
     Board #1
     Board name : Lobby
     Max. msgs. : 100
     Access lvl.: 10

     Board data correct (y/n)? y

     Board #2
     Board name : Continki BBS
     Max. msgs. : 100
     Access lvl.: 10
     
     Board data correct (y/n)? y

     Board #3
     Board name : Help / Bugs
     Max. msgs. : 100
     Access lvl.: 10
     
     Board data correct (y/n)? y


3...TCP/IP setup

This configuration step will configure your Commodore 64 ethernet hardware, including IP addresses, driver and memory location of the cartridge. The example below shows a typical LAN setup using a RRnet or 64NIC+ cartridge at memory address $de08. Both cartridges use the cs8900a.eth driver. ETH64 network devices may use the lan91c96.eth driver along with its appropriate memory address. 

NOTE: do not prefix your memory address with the '$' sign. E.g. if your ethernet cartridge resides at $de08 just enter 'de08' when being prompted for the memory address.

    * BBS network setup

    Host IP             : 192.168.200.64
    Netmask             : 255.255.255.0
    Gateway IP          : 192.168.200.1
    DNS IP              : 192.168.200.1
    Mem addr. ($de08)   : de08
    Driver (cs8900a.eth): cs8900a.eth
    Write to drive # (8): 8
    
    Network data correct (y/n)? y


4...User editor

The user editor is currently very limited. The only thing it does is add users to its database, nothing else. At the moment Contiki BBS does not care about usernames, it does not even distinguish between different users. This will change in future versions of the program. As for now a single user will be all we need. In the example below we just provide a simple 'guest' user with the password 'guest', so we can log in into our new BBS.

    * BBS user editor
    
    (A)add, (E)dit or (L)ist users? A

    * Initializing user databases ...

    User #  : 001
    Username: guest
    Password: guest
    Access lvl.: 10
  
    User data correct (y/n)? y


q...Quit

You have now set up your Contiki BBS system and are ready to run. Quit the BBS setup program from the main menu by entering 'q'.


Running Contiki BBS
------------------
Once you have set up your Contiki BBS, reset your machine or emulator and load the Contiki BBS server from the Commodore 64 BASIC prompt.

1.) Load and run Contiki BBS
    LOAD "CONTIKI-BBS",8,1

2.) Start it...
    RUN

3.) Now use a second machine to connect to the IP address of your Commodore 64 (the Host IP address you entered in Step 3 of the BBS setup program) via telnet.

    $ telnet 192.168.200.64
