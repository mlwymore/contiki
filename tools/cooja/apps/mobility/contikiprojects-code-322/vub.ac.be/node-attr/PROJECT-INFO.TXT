Description:
A library that allows you to define one or more attribute tables for nodes 
in the network (indexed by their rime address). Attributes can be defined 
seperately in various parts of the program, this way programs don't need to
define their own neighbor table or routing table but instead add attributes 
to a globally defined table.
