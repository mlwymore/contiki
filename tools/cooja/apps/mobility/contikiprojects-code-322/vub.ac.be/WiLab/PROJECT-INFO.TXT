Contiki version: Contiki 2.x (CVS version august 2010)
Intended platforms: TMote Sky (or variant) testbeds
Description:
UGent's Wilab is a 187 mote managed testbed. All serial output is
captured and stored in a database. The management software was written
with TinyOS deployments in mind, so it requires that all serial 
output is framed in the TinyOS frame format.
This project defines a serial driver for the MSP430 which frames all
"printf" messages terminated by '\n'. As the driver was written with
WiLab compatibility in mind some simplifications are made, but it 
should be fairly simple to extend to more generic compatibility,
should anyone be interested.
