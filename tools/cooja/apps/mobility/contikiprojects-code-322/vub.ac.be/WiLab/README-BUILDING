*) To build the files TestWilabContiki.[java/class] a TinyOS-2.x distribution must be installed. 
   The java file can be created with the nescc-mig tool, the class file can be compiled from 
   the java file from the tinyos-2.x/support/sdk/java folder, or if the TinyOS-2.x/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar 
   file is in the classpath when compiling.
   
*) Only the additional #ifdef WILAB ... #endif header is important in the included contiki-conf file.
   If you have your own version of the contiki-conf file, simply/paste copy this section.
   
*) The serial frames can be activated by compiling with a WILAB flag, e.g.
   > make hello-world.upload DEFINES=WILAB
   Obviously, it is required to reprogram nodes after recompiling.

*) Note that frames can be still read by serialdump (or "make login", which uses serialdump), but they will 
   look like your output surrounded by gibberish (the frame header and footer). 
   Alternatively, you can use the TinyOS serial listening tools (serial forwarder, prettylisten, ...) in 
   tinyos-2.x/support/sdk/c/sf to view your messages or to simply check that they are coming through
   correctly.
