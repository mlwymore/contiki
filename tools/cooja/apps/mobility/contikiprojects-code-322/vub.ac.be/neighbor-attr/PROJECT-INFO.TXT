Name: Neighbor Attribute Lib
Contact: Joris Borms <joris.borms@vub.ac.be>
Contiki version: CVS 2009-11-23
Intended platforms: any (wireless) networked system
Tested platforms: Sentilla JCreate
Description:
A small library that helps keeping track of various neighbor node properties.
This way there is no need to create different neighbor tables all over the place,
there is one central table, and different applications/modules/... can simply 
specify the parameters they want to add. Aside from saving some programming time,
this should save some memory, especially for wide (IPv6) rime addresses.

note: I'm unsure whether to support this or node-addr. Any ideas? :)
