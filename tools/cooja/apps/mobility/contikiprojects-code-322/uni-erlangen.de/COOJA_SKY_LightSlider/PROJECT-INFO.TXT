Intended platforms: Tmote Sky
Tested platforms: Tmote Sky
Description:
This adds two sliders to the interface-viewer of the Sky-mote. 
Using these sliders it is possible the chenge the values read by the ADC.
This is in an early stage. While it's working fine, the gui might need some work.
Feel free to contract me.

Info: By default the ADCs generate random numbers. This is still the case until the 
interface is initialized.

Todo:
	* Cleanup Interface
	* Make more Robust: E.g. I have no idea what happens, if the interface is opend 
		multiple times. Patches are wellcome.

Install:
Copy SkyLight.java to <CONTIKI>/tools/cooja/apps/mspsim/src/se/sics/cooja/interfaces
Add "SkyLight.class," to the list of interfaces in getAllMoteInterfaceClasses in 
<CONTIKI>/tools/cooja/apps/mspsim/src/se/sics/cooja/mspmote/SkyMoteType.java
