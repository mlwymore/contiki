Description:
 A simple example on how to trigger a communication from another mote via the serial port (in order to avoid sending unreliable triggers over the air).
Two motes are involved: a main mote, and an answering mote. 
The main mote sends on the serial interface a string composed of three parameters:
- the channel where to send the burst
- the address of the destination where the packets should be sent
- the amount of packets to be sent
The java interface will redirect the output from one serial port to another one. 
The answering mote will receive the string on its serial interface, process it, and send the data accrdingly as requested.


How to run: 
- Download the java rxtx libraries from http://www.rxtx.org/ and place dll and jar files in the same folder
- make main_mote.upload MOTES=XX
- make answering_mote.upload MOTES=YY
- make bind
- Set XX as main mote and YY as answering mote and click on "Bind the two Motes!"

IMPORTANT: Remember to add the http://www.rxtx.org/ libraries!
