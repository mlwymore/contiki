TFTP Server
-----------

A simple TFTP server for Contiki. Features:

- IPv4 and IPv6
- one client only
- octet mode only
- uses cfs to store files
- supports blksize, timeout options
- experimental file execution via exec=1 option
- proper error handling

Please note, that you need a TFTP client which supports setting the blksize
option, as the protocol relies on the packets' sizes to detect the end of a
transfer. The default packet size of 512 is often not suitable for sensor
networks as the link layer packets are much smaller. A value of 60 bytes is safe
in Contiki IPv6.

Integration
-----------

The tftpd folder can be used as a Contiki application. Currently there is no
mechanism to have multiple application directories, either the Makefile.include
from Contiki can be adapted, or this folder can be copied to the Contiki source
tree.

A sample project Makefile should then include

    APPS=tftpd

To start the TFTP server from the project's code:

    AUTOSTART_PROCESSES(..., &tftpd_process, ...);
    // or
    process_start(&tftpd_process);

The util.{c,h} files include varios usefull makros and functions used to avoid
printf calls, as this is increases code size by several kilobytes.

Known Bugs
----------

File system corruption occurred when repeatedly uploading a file under the same
name with different sizes. We have not tracked this down yet however and it's
not sure if this is a Coffe Bug.
