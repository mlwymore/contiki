uAODV Routing
-------------

Adaption of the uAODV implementation to IPv6 and uIP.
In our experiments over a small number of hops, this routing mechanism appeared
to provide faster and more responsive routing than Rime's routing module.

NOTE: The default rebroadcast timeout from Rime's netflood module is lower than
the interval for sending route requests. This leads to malfunction of Rime,
because the pending request (which is waiting for a rebroadcast) is overwritten
by subsequent ones.

- proper address configuration with IPv6
- provides uip_router with an additional unreachability mechanism
- integration into neighbor discovery for reachability information

NOTE: this code depends on util.{c,h} from the TFTP Server, if compiled with
DEBUG=1.
