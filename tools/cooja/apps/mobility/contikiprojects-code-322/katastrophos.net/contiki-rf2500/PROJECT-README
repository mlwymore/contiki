The goal of this project is to make a full-featured port of the Contiki OS
to the ez430 RF2500 board, which is manufactured by Texas Instruments.

Current state of affairs is documented in the file 
"Contiki OS port to ez430-RF2500.pdf" , which should reside in the same
directory as the file you are currently reading.

Presently most of the memory is occupied by the serial line shell and
all drivers run as an application process. Those who would like to contribute
would do well by becoming accustomed to debugging with GDB (or some
well-configurable front-end of it).

The worst current problem is the small RAM of 1kb. One possible way to go
would be removing the serial line shell and trying to include a communication
stack, if the size of the RAM is sufficient.

Next step then would be to port sensor drivers to proper APIs.
