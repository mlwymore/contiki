Description:

This project provides an Augmented Reality application working on Android platform. The application is developed for the IPSN'10 demo named Augmenting Reality with IP-based Sensor Networks (ttp://www.sics.se/~adam/yazar10augmenting.pdf). 
Application calls RESTful web services to access Light, Temperature sensor readings and Energy usage, and overlays this data over ARToolkit patterns. Each pattern represents a pre-defined IP address. 

For the Augmented Reality part, AndAR - Android Augmented Reality (http://code.google.com/p/andar/), a port of ARToolkit on Android, is used. 

Source code is in <andar-read-only> and ARToolkit patterns are in <andar> directory. <andar> pattern directory should be copied on to the SD card of the Android phone.
