COMPILE and RUN:
cd RestExample
make clean
make rest-example.upload #will compile and upload the example to all the tmote skys connected
sudo make linslip #in linux - need slip protocol to connect
(If does not make sense, first check IP networking example : http://www.sics.se/contiki/tutorials/tutorial-ip-networking-and-web-server-for-the-tmote-sky.html 
For example it shows how to learn the IP address of the gateway) 

NOTE: can try it in minimal-net configuration too (locally on linux), then you need to
make rest-example TARGET=minimal-net
sudo ./rest-example.minimal-net #run the program locally
(Then the IP address will be 192.168.1.2 rather than 172.16.bla.bla)


Configuration:
I assume that we have 2-mote IP network now having IPs 172.16.79.0 (gateway) and 172.16.77.0

TEST:
Will use curl as a client since it is very easy, if you can manage to make it work then you can use restlet, ruby on rails etc to try it further of course if you want :)

Please check the RestExample/rest-example.c source code to see which resources are available. (check the RESOURCE macros in the code).
