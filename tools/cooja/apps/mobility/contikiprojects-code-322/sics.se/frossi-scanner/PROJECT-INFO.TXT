Description:
Frossi is a system that makes the invisible visible: providing
visibility to low-power radio transmissions that are otherwise
invisible. Frossi consists of a Java program and Contiki shell program
that rapidly reads the radio signal strength on a specified channel
and shows it in a window. A very useful debugging tool in wireless
low-power networks.
