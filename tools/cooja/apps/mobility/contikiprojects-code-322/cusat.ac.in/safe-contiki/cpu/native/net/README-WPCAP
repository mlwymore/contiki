Contiki network I/O on Microsoft Windows (including the Cygwin environment) is
implemented based on the quite popular WinPcap library that is available at
http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm.

Developing Contiki network applications most likely involves working with a
network protocol analyzer. Wireshark (formerly known as Ethereal) is a very
popular one that on Windows uses - and actually comes with - the WinPcap
libary. Wireshark is available at http://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

So with Wireshark installed Contiki network I/O doesn't need any additional
components.

On Windows every Contiki application has one obligatory comand line argument
that identifies the Windows network interface to be used by Contiki. While on
Unix those network interfaces are called i.e. '/dev/tap0' they have on Windows
names like '\Device\NPF_{F76B480A-1D31-4B3D-8002-C0EF49185737}'. In order to
avoid the necessity to enter such names on the command line instead the IP
address used by Windows is entered to identify the network interface to be
used by Contiki. Please note that this IP address is _NOT_ the IP address to
be used by Contiki !

Contiki network I/O on Windows uses the same MAC address used by Windows. This
approach often described as IP-Aliasing was primarily choosen because it avoids
putting the network interface into promiscuous mode. The major benefit of this
is the compatibility with WLAN interfaces - which mostly come with Windows
device drivers incapable of promiscuous mode.
