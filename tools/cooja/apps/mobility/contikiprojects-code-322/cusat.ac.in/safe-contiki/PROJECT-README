'Safe Contiki' is a humble attempt to make Contiki free of Safety violations.
'Deputy' is used to achieve this. Deputy is a tool used to eliminate memory 
and type safety violations (like Null pointer reference, array out of bound 
exception, etc) from C programs which are otherwise impossible to detect by 
an ordinary compliler. Since Contiki is fully written in C and it make 
extensive use of pointers and since memory and type safety violations make 
severe problems with wireless sensor nodes, Contiki is an ideal target for 
Deputization.

The project aims to modify all the kernel files of Contiki which are around 
300 in number. Currently only around 70 files have been modified. The work was 
started with the Instant-Contiki 2.2.1 version. Since then a number of 
modifications were done on Contiki. However we continue with the modifications
on the original source files; once the work is over, we will merge the changes
with the latest version then available.

The project is a laborious one requiring a huge amount of manual work. 
Anyone interested can contribute to the work and their details will be 
displayed in the CONTRIBUTORS list.

Deputy is an open source software available at http://deputy.cs.berkeley.edu/. 
The Annotations of Deputy are easy to learn and use. Please go through the
